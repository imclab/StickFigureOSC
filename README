There was no StickFigure example on the NITE Middleware distribution for OSX so I made one using the win32 code.

Additionally, this is wrapped in an XCode project for those that are more familiar with GUI programming. 

As well, there is an extension to this code which streams the data via ofxOsc (oscpack).  See code for osc params.  It should be fairly straightforward!
